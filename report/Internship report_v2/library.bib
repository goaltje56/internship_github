@article{VanOijen2002,
abstract = {In the recently introduced flamelet-generated manifold (FGM) method the$\backslash$nideas of the manifold and the flamelet approach are combined: a manifold$\backslash$nis constructed using one-dimensional (ID) flamelets. In this paper the$\backslash$neffect of flame stretch on the accuracy of the FGM method is$\backslash$ninvestigated. In order to isolate the effect of flame stretch, premixed$\backslash$nmethane/air counterflow flames are simulated. In the case of unit Lewis$\backslash$nnumbers, a I D manifold is sufficient to model the main effects of flame$\backslash$nstretch. A manifold with two progress variables reproduces the results$\backslash$ncomputed using detailed kinetics almost exactly. When non-unit Lewis$\backslash$nnumbers are used, the enthalpy and element composition of the burnt$\backslash$nmixture change, which may influence the mass burning rate significantly.$\backslash$nIf these composition changes are included in the manifold using one$\backslash$nadditional controlling variable, the results agree well with detailed$\backslash$ncomputations.},
